### Diwali Sales Analysis
#### Project Overview
Welcome to my Diwali Sales Analysis project, where I dive into the fascinating world of data to uncover trends and patterns in Diwali sales data using Python and key libraries. This analysis enhances my Python skills and equips me with essential data analysis abilities.

#### Task
My primary task for this project was to analyze Diwali sales data to understand the market demand trends, specifically focusing on gender, age group, region, product category, marital status, demography, and occupation. By delving into these factors, I aimed to gain a comprehensive understanding of how they influence Diwali sales.

#### Key Questions
During this analysis, I sought answers to various questions:

What are the Diwali sales trends when analyzed by gender?

Do specific age groups contribute more to Diwali sales?

How do sales vary across different regions?

Which product categories are most in demand during Diwali?

Does marital status affect Diwali sales?

What insights can be gained from a demographic analysis?

How does occupation influence Diwali purchasing trends?
